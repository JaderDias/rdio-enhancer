To Do
================
* Remove Sort Playlist option on Playlist the user does not have permission to sort.
	* Right now it tries to run but notifies of no permission
* Reload Playlist after it is sorted
* Import Spotify playlists
* Fix Export to CSV so it can save a filename. Need to figure out a new way to do this; Data URIs currently do not support this.
